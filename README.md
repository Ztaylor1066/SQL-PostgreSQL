This project utilizes PostgreSQL to manipulate data from a larger database. The premise of the project was to provide management with a concise table showing the top renters for any given month so gift cards could be emailed to them.
It includes basic table creation and population as well as functions for data manipulation, triggers for table population, and a stored process which could be put into a scheduler to run every month. I've only provided the SQL code that
I've written in this repository.
